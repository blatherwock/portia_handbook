# Folder README

This folder is where various scripts expect a copy of the game database to be (named `game_db.db`) so that they can extract the necessary information. You can find the game db in your installation of My Time at Portia at `<Program Directory>\Portia_Data\StreamingAssets\CccData\LocalDb.bytes`
