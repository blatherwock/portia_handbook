2. It said this file was compressed and gave option to uncompress it.
3. Click `Info`, highlighted the lines with type `Texture2D`, clicked `Plugins` and `Export to .png`.
4. Place in this directory, now the extract script will attempt to match the images from the game to the item information extracted from the game db.
